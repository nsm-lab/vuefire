# What is the Cookbook

Here are some recipes that you may find useful. If you find a usecase that is missing, you can check if it isn't yet on [the roadmap](https://github.com/vuejs/vuefire/issues/145) or open an issue. You could also directly open a Pull request, but I recommend you to open an issue first so you don't end up wasting your time writing something that won't get published.
