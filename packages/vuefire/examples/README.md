# Vuefire Examples

Here are some examples using Firestore. For bigger projects, we recommend checking [the official documentation](https://vuefire.vuejs.org/)

In order to run the examples make sure to have the dist version of vuefire. You can generate it by going into `packages/vuefire` folder and running `yarn build`/`npm run build`
